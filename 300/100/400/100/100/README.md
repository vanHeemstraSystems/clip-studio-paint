# 100 - Uploading

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

By uploading works drawn on the tablet to the Clip Cloud, you can download and edit them later on another device.

To upload a work to the Clip Studio cloud, tap [In this app] on the [Manage works] screen.

Select the [Sync now] button for the work you want to share to upload to the cloud.

**Note:**

For works with multiple pages, it displays the thumbnails of the folders containing each page. The thumbnail shows the first page.

You can upload the whole work displayed in the thumbnail to Clip Studio cloud. You can not upload only certain pages in the work.
