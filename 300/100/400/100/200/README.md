# 200 - Downloading Works from Clip Studio Cloud

You can also upload works drawn on your computer to the Clip Studio cloud, then download and edit them on your tablet.

To download a work from the Clip Studio cloud to your tablet, go to the “Manage works” screen, and select [Cloud].

Select the [Download as new] or [Download and overwrite] icon for the works you want to edit.

**Note:**

For works with multiple pages, it displays the thumbnails of the folders containing each page. The thumbnail shows the first page.

You can download the whole work displayed in the thumbnail from the Clip Studio cloud. You can not download only certain pages in the work.
