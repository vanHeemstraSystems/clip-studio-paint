The illustration drawn on cel "1" is displayed on the canvas. This is called an "onion skin".

[Memo]

Onion skin is a function that displays the cels surrounding the selected cel to help you keep the cels consistent. See "Tips: Onion skin" for information on changing the display color and number of displayed cels in the onion skin.

4. When you have finished the draft, select the [Move layer] tool and drag the canvas.

The second cel was initially drawn in the same position as the previous cel, but for this animation the character is moving forward, so select the layer for cel "2" and move it to the left.

Once you have drawn drafts for all of the cels, the draft process is complete.

This hides the onion skin.

<Tips: Onion skin>

Onion skin is a function for displaying the cels surrounding the selected cel to help you keep the cels consistent. You can show or hide the onion skin by clicking [Enable onion skin] on the [Timeline] palette. Displaying the onion skin allows you to refer to cels that have already been drawn when drawing the current cel.

You can set the display color and number of cels displayed for the onion skin by selecting the [Animation] menu → [Show animation cels] → [Onion skin settings] to display the [Onion skin settings] dialog box.
