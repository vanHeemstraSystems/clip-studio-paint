Add a layer to cel "1" (layer folder) and start inking.

4. Select the "Draft" layer and change [Opacity] to 50%.

Lowering the opacity of the draft makes it easier to see the inking lines.

[Memo]

- For details on inking, see ["Try Drawing an Illustration in CLIP STUDIO PAINT Basic Guide" → "Inking"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/544).

- If you cannot ink the layer, see ["If You Cannot Draw on a Cel (Layer)"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/527#2e68c47e).

6. Click the [Show/Hide Layer] icon on the left of the "Draft" layer to turn it off.

This hides the "Draft" layer so that only the line drawing is shown.

<Draw the rest of the cels>

Create layers and ink the drawings for cels "2" and onward in the same way as cel "1".

When you have finished inking, your layers will look like this.

When you have finished inking, select the [Tool] palette → [Operation] tool → [Edit timeline] tool and click the canvas to check the motion of the line drawings. If there are any issues in the line drawing, fix them before coloring the drawings.
