# 300 - Coloring

Create a coloring layer for each cel and start coloring.

[Memo]

- For details on coloring, see ["Try Drawing an Illustration in CLIP STUDIO PAINT Basic Guide" → "Basic Coloring"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/545) and ["Drawing the Fine Details"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/546).

- See ["If You Cannot Draw on a Cel (Layer)"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/527#2e68c47e) if you cannot color the layer.

In this case, we have created layers and colored each cel as shown below.

When you have finished coloring, select the [Tool] palette → [Operation] tool→[Edit timeline] tool. Click the canvas to check the motion after coloring. If there are any issues, fix the coloring.
