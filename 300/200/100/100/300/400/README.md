# 400 - If You Cannot Draw on a Cel (Layer)

If you cannot draw lines or color on a cel in the [Animation] folder, check the following points.

<Is the Animation Folder or Layer Folder Selected?>

You cannot draw on cels if an animation folder or layer folder is not selected. Select the layer to be drawn on the [Layer] palette.

<Is the Layer Folder Name Displayed on the [Timeline] Palette?>

Check that the name of the cel (layer folder) containing the layer to be edited is displayed on the [Timeline] palette. Cels in the [Animation] folder need to be specified on the [Timeline] palette before they can be edited.

If the name of the cel in the animation folder is different from the cel name specified on the [Timeline] palette, change the name of the cel on the [Layer] palette so that it matches the cel name specified on the [Timeline] palette.

In this example, there is no cel with the same name as cel "4" on the [Timeline] palette. Change the name "Folder 4" to "4".

<Has the Cel Been Added as a New Cel?>

When you add a new cel to the animation folder, you need to specify the cel on the [Timeline] palette.

Right click the frame on the [Timeline] palette. This displays a popup menu. Select the name of the new cel you have added.

On the tablet version, when pressing and holding a frame with your finger, a popup menu is displayed.

[Memo]

If you cannot see the frame where you want to specify the cel on the [Timeline] palette, change the playback time. See ["Change the Playback Time"](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/529) for details on changing this.

<Has the Inking or Coloring Layer Been Created Outside the Layer Folder?>

If the inking or coloring layer has been created outside the layer folder, drag and drop the layer into the layer folder.
