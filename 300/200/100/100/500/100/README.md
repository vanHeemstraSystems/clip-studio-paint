# 100 - Change the Playback Time

The playback speed is currently too fast. Change it by making the playback time longer.

Move the mouse cursor to the [End frame] on the [Timeline] palette and drag it to the right. In this case, we are dragging it to the 8th frame.

[Memo]

In DEBUT and PRO, you can extend the playback time to a maximum of 24 frames.

Click [Play/Stop] on the [Timeline] palette to play your moving illustration. You'll notice that the playback time is longer but no cels or paper layers are displayed during the last part of the clip. Edit how the cels and paper layers are displayed (see the next section, "Edit the Cel Display".
