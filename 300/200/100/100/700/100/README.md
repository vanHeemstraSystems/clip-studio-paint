# 100 - Animated GIF

Animated GIFs are supported by various web services such as social media. This is therefore an ideal format for posting your finished work online. Animated GIFs also have a smaller file size than movie files. However, they can only be exported in up to 256 colors.

This section explains how to export your finished work as an animated GIF.

[Memo]

If you will be posting your animated GIF on a web server such as social media, be aware that there may be file size limits such as a maximum [Width] or [Height]. Check the rules of the service you will be using before you export your work.

1. Select the [File] menu→[Export animation]→[Animated GIF].

2. In the [Save As] dialog box, select the folder in which to save your work and click [Save].

[Memo]

When using the Galaxy/Android/Chromebook version, the [Save As] dialog is not displayed. Please proceed to the next step.

3. The [Animated GIF export settings] dialog box is displayed. Check the settings and click [OK].

[Memo]

If the file is too large for the web service you want to use, click [OK] and then export the file again in a smaller size. You can reduce the file size by setting smaller values for [Width], [Height] and [Frame rate] in the [Animated GIF export settings] dialog box.

An animated GIF file is created in the folder specified in step 2.

When using the Galaxy/Android/Chromebook version, the [File operation/Share] dialog box will be displayed, allowing you to check the animated GIF.

By clicking [Share] in the [File operation/Share] dialog box, you can open animated GIF files in other environments or publish them to various social media sites.
