# 100 - Adding Camera Work

Using a 2D camera folder, you can add camerawork to your animations.

Camerawork effects such as scaling and moving backgrounds according to character movement (parallax scrolling) can be added without editing the images themselves.

4. Using the [Object] tool to edit the rectangle on the canvas will add keyframes and register the current settings.

In the 2D camera folder, the following settings can be changed.

1. Dragging the handles will scale the frame up or down.

2. Dragging from the upper control point rotates the frame.

3. Dragging the frame will change the imageâ€™s position.

4. In the [Tool Property] palette, changing the value allows detailed edits. [Layer opacity] can be set as well.

Changes between keyframes will be interpolated and become camerawork.

Between key frames, the 2D camera trajectory of each corner will be visible.
